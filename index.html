      <h1>Apologize</h1>
      <p>
        I trying to use full english (sorry if i made a miss grammar/weird word) because i think your knowledge of english is much better than indonesia (to confide in),
        there's a lot i want to talk  but i will summarize it as short as possible,
        first of all sorry because i poured out my frustration on twitter and it was very overwhelming, on that day i was really frustrated and honestly disappointed with you 
        but after calming down by reading some of our chats (on your new cellphone number and the one that was hijacked) it turned out that <span>it was my fault</span> not you, 
        we agreed not to continue but i even tried to continue relationship even though it was only me who was doing it (bertepuk sebelah tangan).
        i'm honestly really sorry because what i've said on twitter and wa can make you block me from twitter, ig, and even wa. 

        maybe you feel very disturbed by what i said and even block me so i understand why, and
        during the time you blocked me i realized a few things, we are like water and oil (you know what that means right?),
        and i assume that the person who is with you now is probably the right person because he can understand you in just 1 week (mungkin pas baca ini udh jadian jadi ku ucapin congrats) and lastly 
        i hope your relationship lasts until the end and i will continue to support <span>(lu bahagia gua juga bakal bahagia because you finally found someone who makes you happy)</span>, 
        once again sorry and Dimaafin gak na? (i don't want to lose important friends again)

        <p>
          for the things that i have give to you, you can keep it (sorry banget pas itu ku nyuruh kamu buat jual/buang, dan klo emg kamu udh ngelakuinnya ku cuman bisa bilang sorry) and 
          actually there is one more things that i want to give you because next month you will have a birthday (tahun lalu ku gk ngasih kado soalnya,jadi gk enak sama kamu yg ngasih aku gelas) but 
          because it's already rushed like this so i only can give you the money and please, you can use it to buy the gifts that i want to gave you or for traveling. (ku udah ada persiapan buat kasih monitor 
          karena kamu ada bilang butuh buat multitasking dan meja buat kamu naro monitornya,totalnya gak bisa ku sebutin tapi pake sebaik-baiknya ya)
